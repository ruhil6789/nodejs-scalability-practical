<!-- Platform layer -->

<!-- 

Create a modular structure:
Divide your application into separate modules or components, each with a specific responsibility. This aligns with the Node.js best practice of dividing the solution by components.
Implement common utilities:
Create a set of common utilities that can be used across your application. These could be wrapped as npm packages for easy reuse.
Use middleware:
Express.js middleware can act as a platform layer, handling common tasks like authentication, logging, and error handling.
Implement a service layer:
This layer can contain the business logic and act as an intermediary between your routes and data access layer.
Use dependency injection:
This can help in managing dependencies and make your code more modular and testable.
